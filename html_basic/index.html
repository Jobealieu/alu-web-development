    <p>This is my second paragraph. Creating webpages is an exciting journey that opens up many possibilities in the digital world. With HTML, I can structure content and make it accessible to users worldwide.</p>
    
    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
    
    <p>This is my third paragraph. I'm currently studying at ALU and working through web development fundamentals. Each task builds upon the previous one, helping me understand how websites are constructed.</p>
    
    <p>This is my fourth paragraph. Practice makes perfect, and by creating multiple HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and links, I'm building a solid foundation for more advanced web development concepts.</p>
